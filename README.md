# Image-Compression-Using-K-means Clustering
Image Compression Using K-means Clustering Algorithm

Crawling through the web and compressing the scraped images is the key feature of this project. Here the user will open the application and a dialogue box appears where they need to enter the URL to be crawled, all the images are listed in the Content box. Once they click the Scrape button, all the images are downloaded to the current working directory. The user then needs to click the compress button to compress all the images present in the folder. The images are compressed using K-means clustering algorithm.
